          Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner was born at Sir G B Hunter Memorial Hospital
          in Wallsend, Northumberland, England, on 2 October 1951,[11][12][13] the
          eldest of four children of Audrey (née Cowell), a hairdresser, and Ernest 
          Matthew Sumner, a milkman and engineer. He grew up near Wallsend's shipyards,
          which made an impression on him. As a child, he was inspired by the Queen
          Mother waving at him from a Rolls-Royce to divert from the shipyard prospect
          towards a more glamorous life.[14][15] He helped his father deliver milk and
          by ten was "obsessed" with an old Spanish guitar left by an emigrating 
          friend of his father.

          Sting's involvement in human rights began in September 1981, when Martin Lewis included 
          him in the fourth Amnesty International gala, The Secret Policeman's Other Ball, a benefit
          show co-founded by Monty Python member John Cleese.[125] Sting states, "before [the Ball] 
          I did not know about Amnesty, I did not know about its work, I did not know about torture 
          in the world."[126] Following the example set at the 1979 show by Pete Townshend, Sting performed 
          "Roxanne" and "Message in a Bottle" appearing on all four nights at Theatre Royal in London. He also
          led other musicians (The Secret Police) including Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Phil Collins, Donovan, Bob 
          Geldof and Midge Ure in the finale – Sting's reggae-tinged arrangement of Bob Dylan's "I Shall Be Released". 
          The event was the first time that Sting worked with Geldof. His association with Amnesty continued throughout 
          the 1980s and beyond and he took part in Amnesty's human rights concerts.
